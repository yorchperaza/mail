# 🔑 Configuration: auth.public_paths
#
# Defines which request paths bypass all authentication and authorization checks.
# Patterns support:
#   "*"          – global wildcard; matches every path (useful for fully open APIs or dev mode)
#   "/auth/*"    – prefix wildcard; matches any route beginning with "/auth/", e.g.:
#                    /auth/register
#                    /auth/login
#                    /auth/forgot-password
#   "/"          – exact match; only the home page
#   "/docs*"     – fnmatch-style wildcard; matches "/docs", "/docs/index.html", etc.
#
# Combine multiple patterns to open exactly the endpoints you need:
#   public_paths = [
#     "/",         # home
#     "/auth/*",   # all auth flows
#     "/assets/*", # static files
#     "/health"    # health checks
#   ]
#
# To disable all checks (everything public), just use ["*"].

auth {
    token       = "changeme-super-secret"
    jwt_secret  = "changeme-even-more-secret"
    jwt_ttl     = 172800

    # → declare all of our “public” routes here:
    # match-all for dev or fully open API
    public_paths = [
        "*"
    ]
